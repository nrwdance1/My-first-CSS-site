        <h2>Hey.</h2>
        <p class="intro">I am an aspiring web developer and voice over artist, dancer, coach, teacher, actress, dog owner, and beach enthusiast.  My life's path has taken me in many directions because I love to learn and dream.  Stimulated by new people and endeavors, I tend to dive headfirst into whatever has caught my attention.</p>

        <h3>Web Developer</h3>
        <p>I started learning to code while working for the e-Learning department of my Grad School as a production assistant. Part of the job was to assist building and maintaining the department's website which both intrigued and excited me so much so I started learning online and researching it almost obsessively.</p>

        <h3>Ballroom Dancer Instructor & Choreographer</h3>
        <p>Dancing has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember.  It was the first answer I gave when asked what I wanted to be when I grew up.  I choreographed my first group dance performance when I was ten years old. It wasn't until after college and one career later that I found dance again in the form of ballroom and have been with the Arthur Murray Dance Studios for over the past decade.</p>

        <h3>Voice Over Artist</h3>
        <p>Acting was my second passion after dance and I have done various forms including theater and film over the years.  My latest endeavor is performing voiceovers with a focus on commercials, e-learning, and audiobooks.</p>
